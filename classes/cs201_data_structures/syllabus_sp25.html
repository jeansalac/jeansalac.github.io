								Data Structures is all about patterns in trying to organize information. All of the software that we create uses data, in one form or another. There are smart ways to store and retrieve this information. How can you do so, and how can you quantify how efficient your techniques are?

									<br>
									<br>

									<b>Languages:</b> Kotlin
									<br>

									<b>IDE:</b> VSCode. You should download VSCode to your personal machine. We’ll also be doing a fair amount of work in text editors and the terminal.

									<b>Default environment:</b> I will default to Mac OSX in class, for development.
									<br>
									<br>

									I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our physical and virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions should be as inclusive as possible. <b>Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.</b> I strive to create an inclusive and respectful classroom that values diversity. Our individual differences enrich and enhance our understanding of one another and of the world around us. This class welcomes the perspectives of all ethnicities, genders, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities.

These time slots are for you, so use them! If for whatever reason you cannot make it to my student drop-in hours, feel free to make an appointment to see me (info at the top of this page).

The lab assistant schedule, along with the classes they can help with, is posted on the doors of Olin 310 and will be posted on the Moodle site for this class once available.

	                        		<li><b>Not Yet Proficient:</b> The deliverable demonstrates progress towards the learning objective(s), but needs further work and engagement to reach proficiency.</li>

	                        		<li><b>Exemplary:</b> The deliverable demonstrates achievement of the learning objective(s) at a higher level (e.g. more nuance, sophistication, etc).</li>

	                        		In this course, we need to balance flexibility for individuals with structure for teams and the class as a whole.

Therefore, the late work/extension policy varies depending on the type of work.

								<p>
									Computer Science is a collaborative discipline, &amp people who apply computer science concepts and skills both shape and are shaped by social, political, &amp cultural environments beyond themselves. You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates to learn, but collaboration comes with additional repsonsibilities:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to contribute equally and fully to the final product.</b> For example, it is not acceptable to let a teammate “finish the project” without you and put your name on it before submitting it, or work on significant portions of the project without you, or any permutation of this. When pair programming, I expect you to actively work side-by-side with your partner the majority of the time.</li>

									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to be able to explain and/or reproduce your solution individually, if asked.</b> If you do not understand the solution, then you did not contribute fully to the project, and this will hinder your learning of the course material.</li>

									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to follow the written and stated guidelines for any particular project.</b> This includes guidelines from both me (e.g. tools and resources you can use) and your teammates (e.g. when to show up for team meetings).</li>

									<li><b> When you put your name on an assignment or deliverable, it is a contract between you, your teammates (if applicable), and me that this work represents your own work and not the work of someone else.</b> It is never acceptable to turn in a program, or a problem solution, that you have found anywhere (on the Internet, in your textbook or another book, from a friend who took this course before) or commissioned as your own. Making cosmetic changes to someone else’s program or solution (such as changing the variable names or comments) is also not acceptable.</li>
									
									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to credit any assistance you receive.</b> If you receive assistance from anyone (another book, a lab assistant, a classmate, me), you must properly credit your source. If a piece of your program utilizes outside assistance, you might include the following in your program’s comments:</li>
								</ul>
