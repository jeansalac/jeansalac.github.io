								Data Structures is all about patterns in trying to organize information. All of the software that we create uses data, in one form or another. There are smart ways to store and retrieve this information. How can you do so, and how can you quantify how efficient your techniques are?
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Prerequisities:</b> CS111 (Introduction to Computer Science) or an introductory computer science course completed elsewhere. Please talk to me if your background is something other than CS111 or AP CS in high school.

								<p>
								One of my goals for you in this course is for you to continue to develop as an independent programmer and learner. I’m much more interested in what skills and understanding you have mastered by the end of the course than the exact pace at which you master them. However, it isn’t healthy for you or me if you leave everything to the last minute. Therefore, my goal with the following evaluation metrics is to balance providing you flexibility to learn at your own pace while also making sure to spread your learning out over the entire term. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								Towards that end, your performance in this class will be evaluated in three different ways according to learning goals for the course:
								<ol>
									<li><b>Preparation Assignments:</b> Almost all class meetings will have an associated preparation assignment to be completed <b>BEFORE</b> class time to ensure you are ready for the material covered in class. These tasks will be assessed based on completion, not correctness.</li>
									<li><b>Deliverables:</b> Deliverables allow you to practice applying and implementing the concepts covered in class more deeply and with the support of the professor, prefect, course staff, and other resources. Your deliverable will be evaluated based on how closely it meets the requirements in each level outlined in the specifications grading scale below.</li>
									<li><b>Exams:</b> Exams allow you to demonstrate your individual understanding of concepts covered in class. Exam questions will target your understanding of class concepts at different levels according to specifications grading scale below.</li>
								</ol>
								</p>
	                        	<b>Specifications Grading Scale</b>
	                        	<br>
	                        	<p>
	                        		<b>Preparation Assignments:</b> Since preparation assignments are meant to preview the topic we will cover each class, these are graded for completion, not based on specifications.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Deliverables:</b> Each deliverable that you turn in will be evaluated against a checklist of specifications related to one or more of the course learning objectives. I will distribute the checklists I’ll use to assess each deliverable so that you know exactly what constitutes each of these levels.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Exams:</b> Each exam topic will have questions targeting your understanding at "Proficient" and "Exemplary" levels. These questions will be marked with the topic and level of understanding. 
									<br>
									<br>
									Below is the description of the four-level scale:
	                        	</p>
	                        	<ol>
	                        		<li><b>Insufficient Evidence:</b> The deliverable or exam question was not turned in or does not engage with the prompt in the intended manner.</li>
	                        		<li><b>Not Yet Proficient:</b> The deliverable or exam question demonstrates progress towards the learning objective(s), but needs further work and engagement to reach proficiency.</li>
	                        		<li><b> Proficient:</b> The deliverable or exam question demonstrates achievement of the learning objective(s).</li>
	                        		<li><b>Exemplary:</b> The deliverable or exam question demonstrates achievement of the learning objective(s) at a higher level (e.g. more nuance, sophistication, etc).</li>
	                        	</ol>
	                        	<b>Deadline Flexibility</b>
	                        	<p>
	                        		In this course, we need to balance flexibility for individuals with structure for the class as a whole. I also want to help you avoid procrastinating to the point that you can’t get everything submitted by the end of the term. Therefore, the late work/extension policy varies depending on the type of work.
	                        		<br>
	                        		<br>
									<b>Preparation assignments</b> are due 5 minutes after the start of the class meeting to account for slight delays in submission while enabling you to be prepared for the class it is associated with. 
	                        		<br>
	                        		<br>
	                        		<b>Deliverables</b> have a 1-hour grace period after their posted due date and time to account for slight technical delays in submission while allowing evaluation of submissions to start soon after the due date.
	                        		<br>
	                        		<br>
									<b>Exams</b> must be taken during their designated times. Please talk to Jean if you need to make alternate arrangements.
									<br>
	                        		<br>

								<b>Revision Policy</b>
								<p>
	                        	Learning is not a linear process, and learning involves making mistakes and learning from them. Below is the revision policy for each category of work.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Preparation assignments</b>
								<br>
								<b>You cannot revise preparation assignments.</b> These are assessed based on completion, not correctness, so revisions aren't necessary.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Deliverables</b>
	                        	<ul>
									<li>You may revise any deliverable, <b>except for anything due in Week 10 or Finals</b>, as there will not be enough time to revise before grades are due.</li>
	                        		<li><strong>You must turn in a submission that clears at least "Not Yet Proficient" within the 1-hour grace period of the deadline to be eligible for a revision, so I encourage you to turn in a deliverable, even if incomplete.</strong> "Not Yet Proficient" means that there is some evidence of an attempt to meet the learning objectives or answer the prompt in the intended manner.</li>
									<li>You may revise and resubmit individual deliverables ONCE within a week after its evaluation has been released. You may NOT copy a classmate's code in the revisions for your deliverable. I reserve the right to withhold an update to your grade and ask you to explain your revisions if I suspect a violation of this policy.</li>
	                        		<li>Along with your revision, you need to submit a Google Form asking you some questions about what you chose to revise, how you responded to feedback, how the revisions improve the deliverable, etc. <strong>If you don't fill out this form, the course staff and I will NOT re-evaluate your revisions.</strong></li>
	                        	</ul>
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
								<b>Exams</b>
								<br>
								You may revise your answers to preceding exam questions during the Exam 3 and Exam 4 timeslots, because Exam 3 will cover fewer topics because of mid-term break and Exam 4 is during the 2.5 hour-long final exam time slot. Questions on exam revisions will be analogous, but not exactly the same, to the original exam.
								</p>
								<br>
	                        	<b>How Specifications Grading Translates to Course Grades</b>
								<p>
								You need to clear the letter grade threshold in <b>all three categories</b>: preparation assignments, deliverables, and exams. This means you cannot rely on any one category to "boost" your grade
								<ol>
									<li><b>To earn a D:</b>You must have completed at least 65% of preparation assignments, 50% of deliverables at Proficient, and 50% of exam topics at Proficient.</li>
	                        		<li> <b>To earn a C:</b> You must have completed at least 75% of preparation assignments, 75% of deliverables at Proficient, and 75% of exam topics at Proficient.</li>
	                        		<li><b>To earn a B:</b> You must have completed at least 85% of preparation assignments, 100% of deliverables at Proficient, and 100% of exam topics at Proficient.</li>
									<li><b>To earn an A:</b> You must have completed at least 95% of preparation assignments, 90% of deliverables at Exemplary and the remaining 10% of deliverables at Proficient, and 90% of exam topics at Exemplary and the remaining 10% of exam topics at Proficient.</li>
									<li>If you are between letter grades, +/- grades will be awarded based on which letter grade you are closer to (i.e. if you're closer to an A than a B, you get an A-; if you're closer to a B, you get a B+). </li>
									<li>There will be approximately 24 preparation assignments, 12 deliverables, and 13 exam topics throughout the term.</li>
									<li>In the final determination of course grades, if you have any deliverables at "Not Yet Proficient", they can be balanced out with an equal number of deliverables at "Exemplary" to become "Proficients", e.g. one deliverable at "Not Yet Proficient" and one deliverable at "Exemplary" will balance out to two "Proficients".</li>
	                        	</ol>

								<br>
								<b>Proper Attribution</b>
								<p>
									Computer Science is a collaborative discipline, &amp people who apply computer science concepts and skills both shape and are shaped by social, political, &amp cultural environments beyond themselves. You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates to learn, but collaboration comes with additional repsonsibilities:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to contribute equally and fully to the final product.</b> For example, it is not acceptable to let a teammate “finish the project” without you and put your name on it before submitting it, or work on significant portions of the project without you, or any permutation of this. When pair programming, I expect you to actively work side-by-side with your partner the majority of the time.</li>

									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to be able to explain and/or reproduce your solution individually, if asked.</b> If you do not understand the solution, then you did not contribute fully to the project, and this will hinder your learning of the course material.</li>

									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to follow the written and stated guidelines for any particular project.</b> This includes guidelines from both me (e.g. tools and resources you can use) and your teammates (e.g. when to show up for team meetings).</li>

									<li><b> When you put your name on an assignment or deliverable, it is a contract between you, your teammates (if applicable), and me that this work represents your own work and not the work of someone else.</b> It is never acceptable to turn in a program, or a problem solution, that you have found anywhere (on the Internet, in your textbook or another book, from a friend who took this course before) or commissioned as your own. Making cosmetic changes to someone else’s program or solution (such as changing the variable names or comments) is also not acceptable.</li>
									
									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to credit any assistance you receive.</b> If you receive assistance from anyone (another book, a lab assistant, a classmate, me), you must properly credit your source. If a piece of your program utilizes outside assistance, you might include the following in your program’s comments:</li>
								</ul>
								<code>
								# Method to decide how much financial aid students should receive
								<br>
								# I used this StackOverflow post to refresh on the syntax for writing conditional statements in Python: https://stackoverflow.com/link-to-post
								</code>
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>AI Policy</b>
								<p>
									In this new age of AI assistants everywhere, we need to cautiously navigate their relationship with academic honesty together. There are many many ways that generative AI is (sort of) helping you and some are more clearly acceptable or unacceptable than others. I can’t make an exhaustive list of what is allowed and isn’t, because there is just too much and something new is going to pop up within the ten weeks of this term. I will do my best to guide you, but you also are going to need to use good judgment at times (and don’t rely on the AI’s judgment!).
									<br>
									<br>
									If you are in a borderline situation, you could try prefacing your request with something like the following: “I’m working on a programming assignment and need some guidance. I’m not looking for the direct solution, but rather help understanding the concepts involved and strategies for approaching the problem. Could you please provide hints, explanations of relevant topics, or suggest debugging techniques based on my question, without giving away the exact code?”
									<br>
									<br>
									Clearly unacceptable:
									<ul>
										<li>Pasting the entire assignment prompt into anything (even if you don’t use the code that comes out)</li>
										<li>Using GitHub Co-pilot extension in VSCode (If you already have it, you must <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-personal-settings/configure-in-ide#enabling-or-disabling-github-copilot">disable it for all course work</a>.)</li>
										<li>Submitting for credit any code that you did not write yourself (and wasn’t from the starter code). This class is about learning to write the code yourself after all!</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<br>
									Clearly acceptable:
									<ul>
										<li>Asking GenAI to give you practice exam questions to study</li>
										<li>Asking GenAI to explain a class concept that you are struggling with (but triple check it is giving accurate information!)</li>
									</ul>
									<br>
									<br>
									Borderline (i.e. you could easily slip into unacceptable):
									<ul>
										<li>Asking GenAI to help you understand what an assignment is asking</li>
										<li>Asking GenAI to help you understand a bug or error on an assignment</li>
										<li>Asking GenAI a question instead of coming to drop-in hours or talking to me, the prefect, or the course staff.</li>
									</ul>
