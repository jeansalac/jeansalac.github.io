	                        	By now, you’ve taken at least a couple of computer science courses. You know how to program. You might know how to program pretty well. But mostly, you’ve done small-ish projects with clear guidelines and clear outcomes. You may wonder, how close is your experience so far to that of those who develop software — to “real world” programming? What do you need to know about how to write software in the real world to be a successful and independent programmer? Further, what do you need to know about how to be ethical in developing software and working with a team and clients?
	                        	<br>
	                        	<br>
								This course is an introduction to the key concepts of software design, which we’ll loosely define as the art and science of effective and ethical software planning, construction, development, and maintenance. In this class, we’ll focus on the tools, skills, and ideas that good software developers should use in their day-to-day work. The concepts we’ll cover, practice, and discuss will be useful for programs, projects, and teams of any size.

	                        	There are five high-level learning goals in this course:
	                        	</p>
	                        	<ol>

	                        		<li>Create code that is <b>well-written, modular, well-documented, maintainable</b>, and follows acceptable best practices.</li>
	                        		<li>Successfully select and utilize <b>appropriate tools, languages, and methodologies</b> to complete the database-driven web site project.</li>
	                        		<li> Analyze &amp apply <b>ethical reasoning</b> to the software development process.</li>

	                        		<b>Moodle:</b> All course related materials, assignments, projects, readings, and resources will be posted here.
	                        		<br>
									<br>

									<b>CampusWire:</b> All course announcements and changes to assignments, projects, and readings will be posted here. We’ll also use CampusWire for some pre-class discussions about the readings. I highly encourage you to ask and answer questions (e.g. clarifications, bugs, error messages, etc) posted by your peers to foster a community of learning.
									<br>
									<br>

									<b>GitHub Classroom:</b> All starter code for assignments will be distributed here, and your project repositories are hosted here. You will turn in most of your projects on GitHub.
									<br>
									<br>

									<b>Languages:</b> Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Javascript.
									<br>
									<br>

									<b>IDE:</b> VSCode. You should download VSCode to your personal machine. We’ll also be doing a fair amount of work in text editors and the terminal.
									<br>
									<br>
									
									<b>Default environment:</b> I will default to Mac OSX in class, for development.
									<br>
									<br>

									I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our physical and virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions should be as inclusive as possible. <b>Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.</b>
									<br>
									
									I strive to create an inclusive and respectful classroom that values diversity. Our individual differences enrich and enhance our understanding of one another and of the world around us. This class welcomes the perspectives of all ethnicities, genders, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities.

	                        	<p>
	                        	One of my goals for you in this course is for you to continue to develop as an independent programmer and learner. I’m much more interested in what skills and understanding you have mastered by the end of the course than the exact pace at which you master them. However, it isn’t healthy for you or me if you leave everything to the last minute. It also isn’t fair to your team if you haven’t prepared as much as they have. Therefore, my goal with the following evaluation metrics is to balance providing you flexibility to learn at your own pace while also making sure to spread your learning out over the entire term.
	                        	<br>
	                        	<br>
	                        	Towards that end, your performance in this class will be evaluated in three different ways according to the learning goals for the course:
	                        	</p>
	                        	
	                        	<ul>
	                        		<li><b>Group Deliverables:</b> This course consists of a team project that lasts the majority of the course and has components that you will create and get feedback on along the way. Your work will be evaluated on the effectiveness of the process you and your team utilize, the product you attain (and how closely this product meets the project deliverable requirements), and the effectiveness of your team’s collaboration. This contributes to your final grade according to the <i>specifications grading</i> scale outlined below.</li>
	                        		<li><b>Individual Deliverables:</b> Many of the team project deliverables will also have an associated individual portion. The individual deliverables allow you to demonstrate individual mastery of the key learning objectives in this course – which will provide you with more targeted feedback on your performance. These may be programs or written reflections, depending on the learning goal. This contributes to your final grade according to the <i>specifications grading</i> scale outlined below.</li>
									<li><b>Preparation Assignments:</b> Almost all class meetings will have an associated preparation assignment to be completed <b>BEFORE</b> class time to ensure you are ready for the material covered in class. These tasks will be assessed based on completion, not correctness.</li>
	                        	</ul>
	                        	<br>

	                        	<b>Specifications Grading Scale</b>
	                        	<br>
	                        	<p>
	                        		Each deliverable that you turn in will be evaluated against a checklist of specifications related to one or more of the course learning objectives. I will distribute the checklists I’ll use to assess each deliverable so that you know exactly what constitutes each of these levels. I will rank each learning objective, and the overall submission, according to a four-level scale:
	                        	</p>
	                        	<ol>

	                        		<li><b>You must turn in a credible submission within the 1-hour grace period of the deadline to be eligible for a revision, so I encourage you to turn in a deliverable, even if incomplete.</b></li>
									<li>Revisions are due a week after you receive a grade for a deliverable.</li>
	                        		<li>You can revise team deliverables, individual deliverables, or reflections.</li>
	                        		<li>Your revised grade will completely replace your original grade as long as it's higher. If for whatever reason your revision results in a lower grade, I'll keep the original grade.</li>
	                        		<li>Along with your revision, you need to submit a Google Form asking you some questions about what you chose to revise, how you responded to feedback, how the revisions improve the deliverable, etc.</li>
	                        		<li>If the deliverable you want to revise is a team deliverable, you may choose to combine your revision with the next team deliverable, given that the pieces of the project build upon each other.

	                        		<li><b>You cannot revise the final reflection and the final project deliverable.</b> These are due at the end of the term and there is not enough time to revise before grades are due.</li>

	                        	<p>
	                        		In this course, we need to balance flexibility for individuals with structure for teams and the class as a whole. I also want to help you avoid procrastinating to the point that you can’t get everything submitted by the end of the term. Therefore, the late work/extension policy varies depending on the type of work.
	                        		<br>
	                        		<br>
	                        		<b>All deliverables</b> have a 1-hour grace period after their posted due date and time to account for slight technical delays in submission while allowing evaluation of submissions to start soon after the due date. <b>You must turn in a credible submission within the 1-hour grace period from the deadline to be eligible for a revision</b>, so I highly recommend you aim to submit something in the original submission window, even if it isn’t complete, so that you can benefit from feedback and revision.
	                        		<br>
	                        		<br>
	                        		<b>Preparation assignments</b> are due 10 minutes after the start of the class meeting to account for slight delays in submission while enabling you to be prepared for the class it is associated with. 
	                        		<br>
	                        		<br>
	                        		If you’re staring down a deadline that you know you can’t meet, or if you’ve fallen behind, <b>get in touch with me immediately and we’ll make arrangements.</b> While I need to put boundaries in place for my own health and wellness, and for fairness to everyone in the class, I also want to make sure you are progressing in your learning.

									<li><b>To earn an A:</b> You must have at least 90% of deliverables at "Exemplary" and the remaining 10% at "Proficient", and have completed 95% of preparation assignments.</li>
									<li>If you are between letter grades, +/- grades will be awarded based on which letter grade you are closer to (i.e. if you're closer to an A than a B, you get an A-; if you're closer to a B, you get a B+). </li>
									<li>There will be approximately 10 deliverables and 24 preparation assignments throughout the term.</li>

								<b>AI-Assistance</b>
								<p>
									Only use an AI text generator if the assigned work explicitly calls for it or allows it, and follow specific guidelines to disclose which text comes from the AI. Most assigned work (probably all) in this course will NOT allow the use of an AI text/code generator, since you need to develop the skills to both comprehend &amp write code independently. If you already have the GitHub Co-pilot extension in VSCode, you must <a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/configuring-github-copilot-in-your-environment#enabling-or-disabling-github-copilot">disable</a> it for all course work.
								</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Teams</b>
								<p>
									Computer Science is a collaborative discipline, &amp people who apply computer science concepts and skills both shape and are shaped by social, political, &amp cultural environments beyond themselves. You are encouraged to collaborate with your classmates to learn, but collaboration comes with additional repsonsibilities:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>As a member of a team, it is your responsibility to contribute equally and fully to the final product.</b> For example, it is not acceptable to let a teammate “finish the project” without you and put your name on it before submitting it, or work on significant portions of the project without you, or any permutation of this. When pair programming, I expect you to actively work side-by-side with your partner the majority of the time.</li>

									<li><b>As a member of a team, it is your responsibility to be able to explain and/or reproduce your solution individually, if asked.</b> If you do not understand the solution, then you did not contribute fully to the project, and this will hinder your learning of the course material.</li>

									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to follow the written and stated guidelines for any particular project.</b> This includes guidelines from both me (e.g. tools and resources you can use) and your teammates (e.g. when to show up for team meetings).</li>

									<li><b> When you put your name on an assignment or deliverable, it is a contract between you, your teammates (if applicable), and me that this work represents your own work and not the work of someone else.</b> It is never acceptable to turn in a program, or a problem solution, that you have found anywhere (on the Internet, in your textbook or another book, from a friend who took this course before) or commissioned as your own. Making cosmetic changes to someone else’s program or solution (such as changing the variable names or comments) is also not acceptable.</li>
									<li><b>Whether you are working in a team or individually, it is your responsibility to credit any assistance you receive.</b> If you receive assistance from anyone (another book, a lab assistant, a classmate, me), you must properly credit your source. If a piece of your program utilizes outside assistance, you might include the following in your program’s comments:</li>
